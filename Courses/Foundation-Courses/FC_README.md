# 🧩 Foundation Courses  

This folder contains information related to the **foundation courses** offered as part of the official curriculum of the **Master’s Degree in Mathematical Engineering** at the **Complutense University of Madrid (UCM)**.

According to the [official syllabus of the program](https://www.ucm.es/estudios/master-ingenieriamatematica-plan), these courses are designed for students entering the master’s with diverse academic backgrounds. Their purpose is to **provide a homogeneous knowledge base** in key areas, ensuring that all students are adequately prepared to follow the rest of the program.

## 🗂️ Structure of `Foundation-Courses/`

This folder includes all leveling courses that may be required based on a student's academic profile. Its internal structure follows a standardized format:

```plaintext
Foundation-Courses/
│
├── FC_README.md                      # Overview of all foundation courses
│
└── Scientific-Programming/           # Specific course (taken in this case)
    ├── SC_README.md                  # Course-specific structure and contents
    │
    ├── Theory/                       # Lecture notes and theoretical materials
    │   └── ...                       # (More files or subfolders inside)
    └── Exercises_Exams/              # Practices, assignments, exams
        └── ...                       # (More files or subfolders inside)
```

> 📌 **Note:** The ellipses (`...`) indicate that each folder may contain additional materials or nested subdirectories.  
> 📄 Each course folder (e.g., `Scientific-Programming/`) includes its own README (`SC_README.md`) that explains how the materials are organized and what each subfolder contains.

## ✅ Course Taken: *Scientific Programming*

This is the **only foundation course** I was required to take, and it is fully documented in its corresponding subfolder: `Scientific-Programming/`.

The folder includes:

- Assignments and practical work developed during the course  
- Solved exams  
- Source code in Fortran and C  
- Data files and solutions  
- Technical documentation on the development environment, compilation, and execution  
- Official instructions for each exercise

> 📌 **Note:** For detailed technical information, refer to the `SC_README.md` file inside the `Scientific-Programming/` folder, which describes the structure and organization of the course materials.

## ℹ️ Additional Note

The remaining foundation courses **were not part of my academic pathway**, and therefore **no materials or documentation** for them are included in this folder.
