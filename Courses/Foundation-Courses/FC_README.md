# üß© Foundation Courses  

This folder contains information related to the **foundation courses** offered as part of the official curriculum of the **Master‚Äôs Degree in Mathematical Engineering** at the **Complutense University of Madrid (UCM)**.

According to the [official syllabus of the program](https://www.ucm.es/estudios/master-ingenieriamatematica-plan), these courses are designed for students entering the master‚Äôs with diverse academic backgrounds. Their purpose is to **provide a consistent foundational knowledge** in key areas, ensuring that all students are adequately prepared to follow the rest of the program.

## üóÇÔ∏è Structure of `Foundation-Courses/`

This folder includes all leveling courses that may be required depending on each student‚Äôs academic background. The internal folder structure follows a consistent organizational scheme: 

```plaintext
Foundation-Courses/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FC_README.md                      # Overview of all foundation courses
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Scientific-Programming/           # Specific course (taken in this case)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SC_README.md                  # Course-specific structure and contents
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Theory/                       # Lecture notes and theoretical materials
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...                       # (More files or subfolders inside)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Exercises_Exams/              # Assignments, solved problems
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...                       # (More files or subfolders inside)
```

> üìå **Note:** The ellipses (`...`) indicate that each folder may contain additional materials or nested subdirectories.  
> üìÑ Each course folder (e.g., Scientific-Programming/) includes a dedicated README file (SC_README.md) that explains how the materials are organized and what each subfolder contains.

## ‚úÖ Course Completed: *Scientific Programming*
This was the only foundation course I was required to take, and it is fully documented in its corresponding subfolder: `Scientific-Programming/`. 

This folder contains:

- Assignments, programming exercises, solved exams 
- Source code in Fortran and C  
- Data files and solutions  
- Technical documentation on the development environment, compilation, and execution  
- Official instructions for each exercise
 
> üìå **Note:** For detailed technical information, refer to the [`SC_README.md`](./Scientific-Programming/SP_README.md) file inside the `Scientific-Programming/` folder, which describes the structure and content of the course materials.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Additional Note

The other foundation courses listed above were not part of my academic track; therefore, no materials or documentation for them are included in this repository.
