## 🧱 General structure of the Master's program

The official curriculum is divided into the following modules (for full details, see the [official syllabus](https://www.ucm.es/estudios/master-ingenieriamatematica-plan)):

1. **Foundation Courses** *(Complementos de formación)*  
2. **Core Curriculum** *(Contenidos fundamentalesCore Curriculum)*  
3. **Specialization** *(Specialization)*  
4. **Industry Internship** *(Prácticas externas)*  
5. **Master's Thesis** *(Trabajo Fin de Máster (TFM))*

## 🗂️ Structure of `Courses/`
> 📁 **Note**: `Courses/` is a subdirectory of the main repository for the *Master’s in Mathematical Engineering*. It contains only the academic content related to the coursework. Other modules like the Master’s Thesis and the Industry Internship are organized in separate top-level folders.

## 🔍 How to navigate this repository?

The repository is structured to mirror the official academic organization of the Master's program. It is divided into three main folders, each corresponding to a different type of course:

- `Foundation-Courses/` → Preparatory/leveling courses (Module 1)
- `Core-Curriculum/` → Mandatory/core subjects (Module 2)
- `Specialization/` → Elective specialization subjects (Module 3)

Each of these main folders contains:

1. A dedicated `README.md` file that provides an overview of the module and explains the general structure and purpose of the included courses.
2. Subdirectories, each named after a specific course, which contain detailed and organized materials related to that subject.
Each course is organized into its own folder, which includes subdirectories for different types of materials:
- **Theory** → Lecture notes, summaries, class PDFs, etc.  
- **Practicals & Exams** → Solved problems, practice sheets, mock exams or past papers.

This structure provides a clear and progressive access to the content, allowing you to browse the materials by thematic blocks or academic activities.

## 🧩 Foundation-Courses (`Foundation-Courses/`)
↳ Overview: [FC_README.md](./Foundation-Courses/FC_README.md)

This block includes leveling (or bridging) courses taught at the beginning of the master's program, intended to provide foundational knowledge to students coming from diverse academic backgrounds. The requirement to take these courses depends on the student's prior academic profile.

### ✅ Course taken

In my case, I was assigned the following foundation course:

- **Scientific Programming** *(3 ECTS)*  
  ↳ See materials in: `Foundation-Courses/Scientific-Programming/`

### ❌ Courses not taken (not included in this repository)

The following foundation courses were offered by the program but were not required in my case:

- Statistics  
- Linear Algebra and Geometry  
- Optimization  

> 📝 *These courses are not included in the repository since they were not part of my curriculum, based on my academic background.*  
> 📌 *Note: The total number of ECTS credits for the master's degree may exceed the usual 60 if these foundation courses are required.*

## 📚 Core-Curriculum (`Core-Curriculum/`)
↳ Overview: [CC_README.md](./Core-Curriculum/CC_README.md)

This folder contains the core (compulsory) courses of the master's program, corresponding to *Module 1: Core Curriculum*, with a total of **39 ECTS**, covering areas such as:

- Applied Statistics and Data Mining  
- Advanced Numerical Methods  
- Modeling and Simulation in Dynamic Systems  
- Optimization and Logistics  
- Databases  
- Financial Mathematics  

Each course will progressively include:

- Theoretical notes and materials  
- Practice exercises and assignments  
- Evaluations and past exams  
- Source code, notebooks, and simulations

> 🏗️ *Content under development. Materials will be added as the academic year progresses.*

---

## 🧪 Specialization Courses (`Specialization/`)
↳ Overview: [S_README.md](./Specialization/S_README.md)

These are elective courses that make up *Module 2: Specialization*, accounting for a total of **12 ECTS**. They allow students to tailor their academic profile toward specific focus areas such as:

- Forecasting and Time Series  
- Stochastic Simulation  
- Financial Risk Management  
- Probabilistic and Stochastic Models in Logistics  

> 🎯 *I have chosen the **Economathematics** specialization, focusing my academic path on mathematical modeling in finance and risk management. Additionally, I have taken an extra course in **Financial Mathematics** to further strengthen this area of expertise.*

> 📥  *Materials for these courses will be added progressively as they are completed during the academic year.*
