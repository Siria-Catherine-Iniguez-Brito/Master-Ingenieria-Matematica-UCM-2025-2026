# 📚 Core Curriculum


This folder contains content and documentation related to the **core curriculum** of the **Master’s Degree in Mathematical Engineering** at the **Complutense University of Madrid (UCM)**.

According to the [official syllabus](https://www.ucm.es/estudios/master-ingenieriamatematica-plan), the core curriculum (Module 1: *Contenidos Fundamentales*) consists of **mandatory courses** in applied mathematics and computational methods, providing essential training for the rest of the program.

These courses amount to a total of **39 ECTS credits** and lay the groundwork for advanced topics covered later in the program.

## 🗂️ Structure of `Core-Curriculum/`

Each course has its own dedicated folder, which includes the material developed throughout the course: assignments, projects, theory notes, source code, data files, exams, and technical documentation.

## ✅ ENROLLED: All Core Courses

I have registered for all required courses under the core curriculum module, and each folder documents the content covered throughout the semester.

The types of materials included per course may vary but typically contain:

- Lecture notes and reference PDFs  
- Solved exercises and assignments  
- Source code (e.g., Python, SQL, MATLAB, R, etc.)  
- Datasets used in data-driven projects  
- Instructions for reproducibility (e.g., environment setup, dependencies)  
- Exams and practical case studies (when applicable)
