## 🗂️ Structure of `Core-Curriculum/`

Each course has its own dedicated folder, which includes the material developed throughout the course: assignments, projects, theory notes, source code, data files, exams, and technical documentation.

```plaintext

✅ ENROLLED: All Core Courses Completed

I have registered for all required courses under the core curriculum module, and each folder documents the content covered throughout the semester.

The types of materials included per course may vary but typically contain:

- Lecture notes and reference PDFs  
- Solved exercises and assignments  
- Source code (e.g., Python, SQL, MATLAB, R, etc.)  
- Datasets used in data-driven projects  
- Instructions for reproducibility (e.g., environment setup, dependencies)  
- Exams and practical case studies (when applicable)

📎 For technical or organizational details, refer to the `README.md` file inside each course directory.
