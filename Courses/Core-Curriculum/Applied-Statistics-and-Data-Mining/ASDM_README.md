## 📊 Assignments Evaluation

- Each assignment contributes a portion of the final grade, weighted according to complexity and workload.  
- The final project has the highest weight and evaluates integration of all course concepts.  
- Active participation and timely submission are required for a passing grade.  
- Evaluation criteria include correctness, code quality, analysis depth, and presentation.

---

## 📦 Submission and Evaluation Guidelines

✅ **Submission format:**

- Source code and scripts in `.R` or `.py` format.  
- Data files used or processed (CSV, TXT, etc.).  
- A report/document in PDF or Markdown detailing methods, results, and conclusions.  
- Assignments should be submitted as a compressed folder named `AssignmentX_LastName_FirstName.zip` or similar.

📤 **Official submission:**

> 📌 **Note:** Assignments must be submitted via the official university virtual platform or via the channels specified by the instructor.

⚠️ **Important rules:**

- Late submissions may be penalized or not accepted.  
- Plagiarism or copying is strictly prohibited and subject to disciplinary action.  
- Collaboration policies are specified in the course guide; generally, individual work is required unless explicitly allowed.
